<!-- Notes for ReactJS installation
    npm install npx
    npx, yarn, npm are all called as package managers

    npx create-react-app my-app1

    We have to understand the following-
    1) what is NPM?
    2) Module System used in ReactJS, Node applications 
    and also vanilla JS applications
    3) node_modules

    Frameworks-Angular
    Libraries-React

    React has it's own DOM-Virtual DOM
    1) Create UI-Functional Components, Class Components
    2) Event Management
    3) State Management
    4) Hooks
    5) Creating Re-usable Components
    6) Navigation/Routing
    7) State Management

    Problem: if you are facing create-react-app issue
    Solution:

    npm install npx

    npm init
    npm install create-react-app
    npx create-react-app myapp
    npm cache clean --force
    npx create-react-app myapp
    http://localhost:3000/

    Port No-3000
    localhost-server name or address 
    where your application is hosted or running
    npm create-react-app my-app1
    cd my-app1
    npm start

    Steps to create and use a context-
    Create Context
    import { createContext, useState } from 'react';
    const BooksContext = createContext();
    similar to const [count,setCount]=useState();
    If you want to use a context/existing context
    import {useContext} from 'react'
    const {}=useContext(BooksContext);
